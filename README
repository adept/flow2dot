This is a tool to generate nice sequence (flow) diagrams from
textual descriptions, written in Haskell.

This tool generates a diagram _description_, which could be made into
a nice picture with help of Graphviz (www.graphviz.org)

To try it out, run:
  runhaskell flow2dot.hs sample.flow | dot -T png -o sample.png
and view "sample.png" with your favorite picture viewer.
