This is a tool to generate nice sequence (flow) diagrams from
textual descriptions, written in Haskell.

This tool generates a diagram _description_, which could be made into
a nice picture with help of Graphviz (www.graphviz.org)

To try it out, run:
  runhaskell flow2dot.hs sample.flow | dot -T png -o sample.png
and view "sample.png" with your favorite picture viewer. If you
dont get a nice picture and get something else (for example, ugly
segfault from dot), try upgrading to latest Graphviz (2.12 or later)

Latest version could be obtained via:
  darcs pull http://adept.linux.kiev.ua/repos/flow2dot/

Send patches to dastapov@gmail.com (using "darcs send")

Thanks to Cale, quicksilver and roconnor from #haskell for
suggestions on how to modularize this.
