This is a tool to generate nice sequence (flow) diagrams from
textual descriptions, written in Haskell.

This tool generates a diagram _description_, which could be made into
a nice picture with help of Graphviz (www.graphviz.org)

To try it out, run:
  runhaskell flow2dot.hs sample.flow | dot -T png -o sample.png
and view "sample.png" with your favorite picture viewer. If you
dont get a nice picture and get something else (for example, ugly
segfault from dot), try upgrading to latest Graphviz (2.12 or later)

If you want to use national alphabets, make sure that your .flow files
are encoded in UTF-8. If you want to tweak the output - read Dot manual
and use it for scaling, colors, pagination etc.

Latest version could be obtained via:
  darcs pull http://adept.linux.kiev.ua/repos/flow2dot/

Thanks to Cale, quicksilver and roconnor from #haskell for
suggestions on how to modularize this. Thanks to Dema from
haskell@conference.jabber.ru for win32 testing.
